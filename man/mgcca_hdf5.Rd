\arguments{
\item{x}{string for hdf5 file where data to process will be under MGCCA_IN group .
Results will be stored in the same data file under MGCCA_OUT group. Missing is not allowed  (see details).}

\item{filename}{string for hdf5 file where data to process will be under MGCCA_IN group .
Results will be stored in the same data file under MGCCA_OUT group. Missing is not allowed  (see details).}

\item{nfac}{...}

\item{pval}{should p-values of correlation between variables and shared canonical variates be computed? Default is TRUE.}

\item{scores}{should canonical variables be computed for each table?
Default is FALSE. See details}

\item{method}{...}

\item{lambda}{...}

\item{mc.cores}{...}

\item{datanames}{string array with datasetnames to use with mcgga}

\value{
a list consisting of
  \item{Y}{canonical components for the shared space}
  \item{corsY}{correlation between variables and shared canonical components}
  \item{scores}{canonical componets for each table}
  \item{p.values}{p-values of correlation between variables and shared canonical components}
  \item{AVE}{indicators of model quality based on the Average Variance Explained (AVE): AVE for each table, AVE_outer (average accross tables), AVE_inner(for the shared component).}
